-INSTALATION-

In order to compile you need the following installed on the system.

bamtools - https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools
openssl - 
GMP

We use the platfrom independent make system cmake http://www.cmake.org/

To install on Ubuntu simply run,
$ sudo apt-get install cmake

Cmake will try and find the location of the required libraries to configure
  the location yourself use the ccmake gui.
$ sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
$ ccmake .

Once configured you can (re)generate Makefile's via
$ cmake .

And then compile as usual
$ make


There are a few optional tools that really ease development:
  guard - https://github.com/guard/guard
  googletest - http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

  #TODO: add install instructions
  #TODO: add libnotify info

  If tests are undersired you can disable all tests.
    Simply change the 'build_all_tests' setting to OFF in CMakeLists.txt.

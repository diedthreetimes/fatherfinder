//This is a sequence with special attributes, namely name and "cut"

// Alternate form where the cut is specified as two strings

// Here the cut position is the first element to appear in the second string (0 based)

//first
//last

//Make this a templated class on a type of AbstractSequence (thus we can store our enzymes in something other than string)

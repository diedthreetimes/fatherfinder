//Implement an abstract sequence via bamtools
// This reader will handle all statistical processing
// For now this is none, we simply read in the "mapped" bam files

// Some things to consider
//   - Map Quality?


// There is a lot of "interesting" fields in both the bam and bas files,
//   but the literature on it seems to expect at least some prior knowledge
//   for now we just do the naieve thing and ignore it all (hoping our algorithim provides enough resilience)
